### ✨&nbsp; About Me

With over 15 years of experience in software development, I specialize in designing robust, scalable applications using Node.js, TypeScript, and React, underpinned by Clean Architecture and solid testing practices.

My background spans over 8 years in team leadership, guiding multicultural teams toward high-impact solutions, and 5 years
building efficient, cloud-native systems with a wide range of AWS services. I bring deep expertise in SQL and MongoDB, ensuring performance and data integrity across complex systems.

Outside of work, I'm fiercely loyal to the things that energize me — sports, great food, and exploring the world.
